Chimera - Observatory Automation System
=======================================

Installation:

Before installing Chimera, install the following packages using the standard way
on your distribution.

For basic chimera: python-setuptools python-dev python-numpy saods9 sextractor
For SBIG support: libusb-dev swig
For chimera-gui: libcfitsio3-dev python-gtk2-dev python-gobject-dev python-pygoocanvas python-gdl

To enable WCS and pointing verification, install astrometry.net and the required
indices (see www.astrometry.net for information about the indices, which we could
not redistribute).

To run unit tests also install python-nose.

To generate API documentation also install python-epydoc.

Ubuntu 9.10 and later
=====================

Here is the full command line to use on Ubuntu 9.10 to get all the requirements:

sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev python-numpy sextractor libusb-dev swig \
libcfitsio3-dev python-gtk2-dev python-gobject-dev python-pygoocanvas python-gdl \
python-nose python-epydoc

Ubuntu 9.04
===========

Replace python-gdl by python-gnome2-extras.

DS9 and XPA
===========

Ubuntu's saods9 package is broken, you'll need to  install it manually.
Chimera needs xpa tools too, it's available on DS9 site as well.
Make sure all this binaries are anywhere on your $PATH.

libbip
======

Chimera uses libbip image display library, unfortunately this packages doesn't have
an Ubuntu package yet, so you'll need to install it manually.

Checkout the source and do a standard .configure; make; make install.

See INSTALL file on fits-display source for more information.

Step by step:

$ svn co http://fits-display.googlecode.com/svn/trunk fits-display
$ cd fits-display
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-python
$ make
$ sudo make install

Chimera on Linux
================

$ cd <uncompressed_chimera_dir>
# su
# python setup.py install 

setup.py must be run as root user to install Chimera on a system-wide basis.

Chimera on Windows
==================

Install Tortoise SVN

Then run on command line (on the same directory where you checked out chimera) 

python setup.py install
