Chimera - Observatory Automation System
=======================================

Installation:

Before installing Chimera, install the following packages using the standard way
on your distribution.

For basic chimera: python-dev python-numpy saods9 sextractor
For SBIG support: libusb-dev swig
For chimera-gui: libcfitsio3-dev python-gtk2-dev python-gobject-dev python-pygoocanvas python-gdl

To enable WCS and pointing verification, install astrometry.net and the required
indices (see www.astrometry.net for information about the indices, which we could
not redistribute).

To run unit tests also install python-nose.

To generate API documentation also install python-epydoc.

Here is the full command line to use on Ubuntu 9.10 to get all the requirements:

sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy saods9 sextractor libusb-dev swig \
libcfitsio3-dev python-gtk2-dev python-gobject-dev python-pygoocanvas python-gdl \
python-nose python-epydoc

Notes for Ubuntu 9.04:

Replace python-gdl by python-gnome2-extras.

saods9 packages is broken, so remove it from the list and install
it manually. Chimera needs xpa tools too, it's available on DS9 site as well.
Make sure all this binaries are anywhere on your $PATH.

After that,

$ cd <uncompressed_chimera_dir>
# su
# python setup.py install 

setup.py must be run as root user to install Chimera on a system-wide basis.

Windows install:

Install Tortoise SVN
Use SVN Checkout and download the code.
Then run on command line (on the same directory where you checked out chimera) 

python setup.py install

just like the unix version
